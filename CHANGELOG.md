# Changelog

All notable changes to the "grannepack-html" extension pack will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [0.5.1] - 2022-01-29

I forgot to add [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) to `package.json`, so that silly mistake is now fixed.

Total count: 13 extensions & 2 themes.

## [0.5] - 2021-07-14

Removed the following extension, because Microsoft now offers the equivalent with Live Preview:

* [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer): see changes to your webpages as you update your code

Added the following extension by Microsoft, which replaces Live Server:

* [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server): hosts a local server in your workspace for you to preview your webpages

Total count: 12 extensions & 2 themes.

## [0.4] - 2020-04-09

Removed the following extensions:

* Auto Rename Tag by Jun Han (as of VS Code 1.44, the functionality, called *Synced Regions*, is built in & detailed at <https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_44#_synced-regions>)

## [0.3] - 2019-11-08

Removed the following extensions: 

* expand-region by Le Trieu (the built-in Emmet commands `Emmet: Balance (outward)` & `Emmet: Balance (inward)` perform this function; I recommend adding a key command like `Alt+W` for `Emmet: Balance (outward)` & `Shift+Alt+X` for `Emmet: Balance (inward)`)
* Sort Lines by Tyriar (now built in to Visual Studio Code)

Total count: 13 extensions & 2 themes.

## [0.2] - 2019-05-28

* Fixed numbering & date in CHANGELOG.md.
* Updated links to other GrannePacks in README.md.

## [0.1] - 2019-05-28

Initial release, with 15 extensions & 2 themes.
