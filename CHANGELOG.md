# Change Log

All notable changes to the "grannepack-html" extension pack will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). 

## [0.3] - 2019-11-08

Removed the following extensions: 

* expand-region by Le Trieu (the built-in Emmet commands `Emmet: Balance (outward)` & `Emmet: Balance (inward)` perform this function; I recommend adding a key command like `Alt+W` for `Emmet: Balance (outward)` & `Shift+Alt+X` for `Emmet: Balance (inward)`)
* Sort Lines by Tyriar (now built in to Visual Studio Code)

Total count: 13 extensions & 2 themes.

## [0.2] - 2019-05-28

* Fixed numbering & date in CHANGELOG.md.
* Updated links to other GrannePacks in README.md.

## [0.1] - 2019-05-28
